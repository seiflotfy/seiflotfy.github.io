I am kinda proud and disappointed...

I am proud that the Zeitgeist team managed to start a project that tackles some of these points. Zeitgeist is aware of activities of other apps and can share it with them, as well of occurring events on the desktop. With the 0.3.3 release of the engine we can do even more. We will introduce a whole new set of machine learning algorithms, and believe me it will blow your mind away. I am blessed to have a team of rockstars hacking on Zeitgeist and GAJ. We got Zeitgeist running on Maemo now and maybe Android soon. (And it all started in my bedroom :P )

I am disappointed because I still don't see GNOME Shell trying to make use of the information we have. I really think it is about time to get things running with Shell. I mean even KDE 4.4 copied our functionality (Zeitgeist-Filesystem) into Nepomuk. We are very  efficient  at what we do and we do it well. We will introduce the Nautilus Integration soon too. I cant see any road map or plan on working with Shell, but our developers are willing to start talking use cases. The Shell guys are an amazing bunch of developers, yet IMHO the Shell development is following too much the beaten track of desktop experience. Until now I can only call what they are doing providing enhanced and better experience, however not really new. When I say providing new experience I am not only talking about Zeitgeist but also Tracker as well. I mean if Shell is not going to make use of Zeitgeist + Tracker for a GNOME 3 experience than who will. Its time to end this phobia towards "semantic desktop". Limiting oneself to an application centric desktop wont help the evolution of GNOME 3. Tracker and Zeitgeist provide ground for  re-scoping of possibilities (Application Centric, Document Centric and Event Centric).  Maybe a little IRC Meeting between the devs  of (Shell, Tracker and Zeitgeist) would be a good idea...

Most of the apps that make use of us are either homegrown (GAJ) or not official GNOME apps (Docky). Our Nautilus integration will most probably land into the Elementary OS Project and not in Nautilus :(

I would love to see Zeitgeist growing to be something like Telepathy in terms of providing a standard for event logging (even if  its in python), and I hope we get there soon. And I hope Nokia and Intel could also make use of what we have and not reinvent the wheel if they like what we do....

P.S: I am thinking of  starting a company with some of the Zeitgeist developers, the first steps have been taken...
