So <a href="http://identi.ca/notice/25049645">David C</a> dented about Zeitbutton

Funny thing is ... We support this functionality already as in "Get files commonly used with the other files"

In this case it would be "Get files most used with Recently Open Files"... It is just a WM hack as far as I know...

You can test the functionality with Zeitgeist(trunk) and GAJ(trunk) by right clicking an item in the journal and asking for "More Information"....

Lets make it happen... Thanks Dave for the inspiration...
