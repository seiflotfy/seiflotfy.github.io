As the topic says, I am working on a filter to filter in/out mimetypes into the timeline! As for now I took out Pidgin an bookmarking so i could improve the speed and memory consumption! They will be built back in soon.

I just noticed <a href="http://gnomejournal.org/ ">gnomejournal.org</a>, thus I think the project needs a new name/codename... I think Gnome Timeline or "Gnome Zeitgeist"(GZG).

I could use some help with a Firefox plugin.. if some1 can send me a sample code of howto read in the firefox history using python i would be very thankful!

Tomorrow i will continue as for now I will sleep! The changes of today will be uploaded tomorrow since they are on my desktop and I am in bed!
