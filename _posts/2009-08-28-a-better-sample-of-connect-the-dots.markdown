title: A better sample of connect the dots! (Zeitgeist data relevancy monitor)

After my last blog post here is a more real life explained sample of data relevancy over context and usage provided by the Zeitgeist Framework:

First some explanations:
<ul>
	<li>The Cricles represent URIs such as "http://youtube.com" or "/home/tom/test.doc". The number you see are ids for these URIs</li>
	<li>The Arrows represent a focus switch from a URI to another (we now can log window activity). One can read it ( 0 --&gt; 1 ) as "focus from URI 0 to 1" in other words focus from "http://youtube.com" to "/home/tom/test.doc". The numberon the arrows represent how many times the focus was switched form one to another.</li>
</ul>
So now for a real life sample of what was happening today around "http://git.codethink.co.uk/" ( To be clear this is an actual graph of what happened directly around the URI)

First he URI to id list:
<ul>
	<li>0 = "http://git.codethink.co.uk/"</li>
	<li>1 = "http://google.com"</li>
	<li>2 = "pidgin://Facebook/Karl Latimer"</li>
	<li>3 = "pidgin://Facebook/Philip Van Hoof"</li>
	<li>4 = "pidgin://Co-Workers/juergbi"</li>
	<li>5 = "pidgin://Co-Workers/einalex"</li>
	<li>6 = "tomboy://Today: Friday, August 28 2009"</li>
</ul>

For a wider neighbourhood here is some more sweetness however I won't write down the URI list but the previous ones still applies:
