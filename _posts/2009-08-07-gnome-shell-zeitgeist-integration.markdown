I think the work of my GSoC student deserves a post on its own! Not only did he work it off all by himself. I barely gave him adivse maybe once or twice directions! He was responsible for the whole engine seperation and now the Shell integration. Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyoD2v7QGCE">this</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEH4G9p5ens">that</a>. And if possbile write a"Thank you Siegfried" comment!
