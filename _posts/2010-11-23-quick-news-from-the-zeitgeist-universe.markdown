At last after a lot of nagging from the team's side we managed to convince Mr. Rockstar <a href="http://thekorn.wordpress.com/">Markus Korn</a> to set up a blog. You can follow his remarkable work on the Zeitgeist engine from there. <a href="http://thekorn.wordpress.com/2010/11/17/on-zeitgeist-optimization/">His latest work on the optimizations on our queries</a> should not go unnoticed. So please drop by and comment.
Also a new AJ hacker is rising, <a href="http://devcando.wordpress.com/">Stefano Candori</a> who has been sending merge requests non stop has set up a blog and we are honored to have him write about <a href="http://devcando.wordpress.com/2010/11/23/me-and-zeitgeist/">his experience with Zeitgeist and the team</a>.

Sometimes I don't have the words to express how happy I am being blessed the team.
