I am amazed by wordpress. My old and first blog (seilo.wordpress.com) has been imported into this page. Kick ass. Lots of old memories and nice pictures too. I am excited like a little kid and happy too. I am cheered up after my Dell XPS M1330 broke. Stupid nVidia GPUs. Pretty crappy I couldn't reach the guys yesterday. I need my notebook. I should have gone for a Thinkpad. Well now I am happy again, since I got Wordpress to work and it was easier than I thought. Still looking for a good theme and a logo. Thursday is one of my last exams. After that its hacking 24/7.
