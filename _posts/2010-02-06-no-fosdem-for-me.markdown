Out of personal and convenience issues i decided not to board the train today.
So I wont attend FOSDEM. However 2 Zeitgeisters will be there. 
Please don't hesitate to contact Hylke Bons (hbons) concerning the GNOME Activity Journal and Siegfried Gevatter (RainCT) concerning Zeitgeist Framework!
Have fun! And lay off the booze! :P
