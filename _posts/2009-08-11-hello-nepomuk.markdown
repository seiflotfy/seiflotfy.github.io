Having so much to blog about (being unemployed and over enthusiastic), I think this specific decision is worth sharing with the world!

Today after some discussion with the rest of the team we pulled it through! Zeitgeist is using the NEPOMUK namespace to support as well as profit from more cross desktop work!

I started the implementation today and did the first commit! There are some talks about creating a migration script! But I think its not necessary if we keep digging out history!

In combination with our new flexible backend module we can easily use tracker storage now!

These features will be part of our 0.2.1 this week or 0.3 release by the end of the month!

GNOME say "Hello NEPOMUK" !!!
