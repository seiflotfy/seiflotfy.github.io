<ol>
	<li>We are currently 5 hardcore developers: Mikkel, Siegfried, Markus, Alex and myself.</li>
	<li>We all can understand as well as speak German (except for Mikkel who refuses to speak in German)</li>
	<li>Currently the overall maintainers of the code are Mikkel, Markus and Siegfried. (We actually maintain our own modules but the 3 guys are much better coders leaving me with management stuff)</li>
	<li>I still get to be the ass in the team.</li>
	<li>Every new feature and decsision undergoes a democratic voting process (read Art of Community)</li>
	<li>Alex and me consider ourselves the R&amp;D sub-team.</li>
	<li>We all are amazed by Tracker now</li>
	<li>Markus is a pessimist and follows almost every sport you can think of.</li>
	<li>Mikkel is a Teletubbies fan and listens to "Michael learns to Rock" :P.</li>
	<li>Alex is a redhead.</li>
	<li>I am fat. And have a crush on Ivan Frade :P</li>
	<li>Siegfried is a jerk. We don't leave Siegfried alone on our computers since he tends to fiddle around and install pygames.</li>
	<li>We ask alot of questions: "Why?" and "The What in the Where now?" are very common.</li>
	<li>"Deine Mudda (Yo Momma)" is usual reply to almost every question or statement.</li>
	<li>"That's what she said!" jokes are gaining popularity (And sometimes the occasional "he said")</li>
	<li>Siegfried and me were refered to as Bart and Homer Simpsons.</li>
	<li>Siegfried is also known as "Kleiner Junge" (he is just 18)</li>
	<li>We are fascinated by the N900</li>
	<li>We love our new Zeitgeist engine</li>
	<li>We are looking for jobs</li>
