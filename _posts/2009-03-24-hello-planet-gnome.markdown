Somehow the first syndications did not leave a good impression!

Well HELLO PLANET GNOME! My name is Seif Lotfy and i am a student (graduating within the next 2 weeks) living in germany (I am egyptian though). I am mainly developing on GNOME Zeitgeist (which is similar Federico's Journal idea). I will be posting about the progress we are making tomorrow first thing in the morning! I hope you enjoy my blog!

Cheers

Seif
