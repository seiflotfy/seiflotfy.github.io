Every couple of weeks I get sick of my desktop look and decide to got with a new one.

This was my desktop 15 minutes ago...

Now the only thing I kept the same besides the font and the panelÂ transparency are the Faenza Icons. What makes me like them is that their squared shape gives them the feeling of good organization.

Now this is my new desktop.

I am using the new Ubuntu wallpaper. I know a lot of people don't like it but IMHO if you give it time its kinda takes you in. It has some depth to it if you give it enough space. Thus I changed Docky to be 3D and removed the side dock. The top panel is semi transparent. This is my personal opinion about my desktop so please no offensive comments.

Here is another picture of a modified elegant gnome theme...

Hope you like it...
