So by now everyone should be familiar with Randy Barlow. He is one of the GAJ maintainer and core developers. I am not going to say much, just read his latest 2 blog posts about "<a href="http://velourdrome.blogspot.com/2010/03/zeitgesitsharp-and-banshee.html">ZeitgesitSharp, and Banshee</a>" and "<a href="http://velourdrome.blogspot.com/2010/04/gnome-activity-journal-and-displaying.html">GNOME Activity Journal and displaying events without backing files</a>"

Also a quick teaser for GAJ displaying BZR, Telepathy and Firefox events...
