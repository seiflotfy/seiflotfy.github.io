So Jason Smith approaches me after I was fiddling with Teamgeist.

Baiscally we gave Docky some awesomeness by providing its folders the knowledge of what it uses most.

After 1 hour or a bit moreÂ we had code. It is simple and I would love to see that in Shell. There will be much more Zeitgeist + Docky in the future. Of course stay tuned for other kick ass extensions, namely Teamgeist and Synapse.
