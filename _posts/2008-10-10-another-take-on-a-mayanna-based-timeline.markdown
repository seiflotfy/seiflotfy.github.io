hi guys at UI-Hackfest! Thanks alot for all your hard work! I wish I could have been there! Instead I was in faggy old germany helping my girlfriend move from cologne to munich!

Here is a quick take on what I think could be a good standalone timeline for Gnome! Its a quick mayanna modification that needs a better layout! but all the time thingies are right and u can drag and drop from it :) cool huh?
