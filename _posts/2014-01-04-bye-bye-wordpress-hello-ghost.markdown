Finally managed to move away from Wordpress. One of the reasons I did less blogging is that I felt that Wordpress became more of a CMS and less of a blogging platform.

I stumbled upon ghost which I must say is just awesome... Its done for blogging and blogging only :D


I will be bloging more again now. Recently I have been more active doing upstream openstack development and some sweet Mozilla hacks.
Stay tuned...
