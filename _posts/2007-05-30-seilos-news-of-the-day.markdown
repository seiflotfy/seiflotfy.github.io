<p style="text-align:left;">OK i am an engineer and computer scientist. So here are the headlines from the technology world that caught my attention on <span>OSNews</span> today:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070529-microsoftnovell-agreement-may-exclude-patent-protection-for-wine-openoffice.html">Microsoft-Novell Agreement May Exclude Wine, OpenOffice</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Hmmmmmmmm i don't know if people who read my blog are familiar with this topic, but to understand the problem here you must be a GNU/Linux fanatic. As an                     Ubuntu and Debian user I am really not a big fan of the agreement. However if you feel like catching up with this topic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft-Novell_agreement">here</a> is a what wikipedia has to say about it.</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/industry/4217348.html">Microsoft Unveils Multi-Touch Interface Computer</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Holy Cow!!!  This is amazing. I need this for my room :) . I am not the biggest Microsoft products fan but WOW!!!</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:left;">On BBC here are the news that caught my attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6700709.stm">Guantanamo plea for Johnston</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>I wonder how the U.S. allowed this guy to give such a letter to his lawyer. Its not exactly a plus point for the U.S. when a prisoner goes  "Oh lets try to be better than             them". Eventually i will start writing about the whole Guantanamo topic later.</blockquote>

	<li><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6700021.stm">Syria's Assad wins another term</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Hahaha imagine a ballot in which he was the <strong>only candidate</strong>, of course your going to win. HAHAHA</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://newsforums.bbc.co.uk/nol/thread.jspa?threadID=6444&amp;edition=1"> Discussing "How best to resolve the legacy of 1967 war?"</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>Mixed opinions and very fun to read. This always <span>brings</span> me back to the point "How can one solve this problem?"My opinion is, its to late to evict all <span>Israelis</span> out of                      Israel. Still I think this regime gets to do <span>alot</span> of stuff that isn't really fair towards <span>Palestinians</span>. And although they compare themselves to western countries, Israel itself              is a country based on a religion. You will never see a non-<span>jewish</span> president in Israel. Sometimes i think <span>Israel</span> occupies <span>neighboring</span> countries not only for safety reasons.              If this is a danger zone why  build settlements. I guess the reason is that many <span>Israelis</span> came form neighboring countries and somehow they would like to return back                  there but under their own  government.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Don't get me wrong I am not saying Israel is bad. Its the best functioning country in the region however its because they are a unity and they are <span>being</span> supported by              the U.S. If some <span>(non-<span>corrupt</span>) Arabic</span> country had the privilege of being supported that much by another Western country. I bet you they <span>would</span> be able to live with <span>                 Israel </span>as a neighbor.</blockquote>
Well i can keep on going with that so better stop now. As you can see this is another odd region in this odd world.
