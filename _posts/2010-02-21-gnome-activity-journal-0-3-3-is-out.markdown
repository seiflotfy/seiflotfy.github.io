First the Release Announcement:
<blockquote><strong>GNOME Activity Journal 0.3.3 - "Patrick Star meets Lady Gaga"
</strong> ==============================================

The GAJ &amp; Zeitgeist team, are proud to announce the second development release of GNOME Activity Journal, codenamed "Patrick Star meets Lady Gaga".

<strong>What is GNOME Activity Journal?
</strong> =========================

GNOME Activity Journal is not a File Browser but an Activity Browser. It uses the ZeitgeistFramework to display what you did and introduces a better way of finding the things that you were doing quickly.
