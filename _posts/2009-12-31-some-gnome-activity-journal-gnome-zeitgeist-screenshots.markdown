So after some cleanup we decided to upload these pics before new years starts. Development is going very fast thanks to the Zeitgeist Framework 0.3 series. This is not our final design and there are ofcourse some usability flaws. We welcome critics, praises and suggestions.

Here is the default layout.

<a href="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/12/Screenshot-8.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1018" title="Screenshot-8" src="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/12/Screenshot-8.png" alt="Screenshot-8" width="487" height="234" /></a>

You can group specific file types to not get into your way...

<a href="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/12/Screenshot-51.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1014" title="Screenshot-5" src="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/12/Screenshot-51.png" alt="Screenshot-5" width="488" height="233" /></a>

Here you see the second view (list view). One can change both views using the buttons in the toolbar.

<a href="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/12/Screenshot-6.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1015" title="Screenshot-6" src="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/12/Screenshot-6.png" alt="Screenshot-6" width="492" height="301" /></a>

One can also show the times by enabling the "Show Time" checkbox on the bottom right.

<a href="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/12/Screenshot-7.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1016" title="Screenshot-7" src="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/12/Screenshot-7.png" alt="Screenshot-7" width="492" height="234" /></a>

So this is all for now. To run it you need the latest zeitgeist from
<blockquote>bzr branch lp:zeitgeist

cd zeitgeist

./autogen.sh

make

sudo make install</blockquote>
Then you will need the gnome activity journal
<blockquote>bzr branch lp:gnome-activity-journal

cd gnome-activity-journal

./gnome-activity-journal</blockquote>
There is still a bunch of things missing like
<ul>
	<li>Bookmarking and tagging</li>
	<li>Searching</li>
	<li>Calendar</li>
	<li>Interactions with the items</li>
	<li>Enable websites support</li>
</ul>
HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE
