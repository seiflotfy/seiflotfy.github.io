Natan Yellin and I have been organizing a lot in the code. Natan stumbled up on SpiffGtkWidgets and managed to integrate it into the code. Although the display is amazing its pretty slow. Thus Natan and I decided to hack on it and upload our patches :).

A couple of new features will be added and/or are under development, most importantly:
<ol>
	<li>Search! We need to be able to search</li>
	<li>Bookmarking! I took out the bookmarking code to re-implement it at some point.</li>
	<li>Tags! Tagging items would be really a cool feature however we need a database for it</li>
	<li>Two new Iconviews Placeholders. "Frequently Used" and "Bookmarked". I think the names say it all!</li>
	<li>We are considering of storing History in an sqlight database! We need the communities  opinion on it</li>
	<li>Option of choosing a backend engine such as Tracker</li>
</ol>
Another very important thing is the naming of the Project! right now alot of the code is still related to mayanna-legacy! However since I will be also working on the new mayanna version I think renaming the classes and projects would be a good choice since alot of the original code  has been changed and reduced. My suggestions would be:
<ul>
	<li>Gnome Zeitgeist (The options of bookmarking and frequently used should encourage this name)</li>
	<li>Gnome Reflaction (the a is on purpose :-) ) .. Ã  la reflection in/for action</li>
	<li>Gnome Did (sounds too much like Gnome Do though)</li>
	<li>Gnome Timeline</li>
	<li>Gnome Useline</li>
</ul>
More to come! Need to take a Nap
