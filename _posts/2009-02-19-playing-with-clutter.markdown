To learn clutter i started fiddling around trying to build a new UI for Zeitgeist. A pre-alpha-protoype would turned out to be....<a href="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/02/out.ogv">Zeitgeist UI 2</a>

its in the bzr repo just pull from there.

try it be running sh zeitgeist2.sh (there is a 2 hidden there)

Here is another mockup from Kalle Persson
