Well I took some time to revisit the Zeitgeist helper for docky...

Now the jump lists provide you with "Most Used Items" withing the last 2 weeks plus "Other Recently Used Items" that don't appear in the most used. Its not the biggest hack but I find it awesome for myself. I really can get almost 50% of the things i want by just right clicking an app in Docky. It the app is closed or the document is not opened you have a good chance of finding it in the jumplist by just right clicking on the app responsible for it...

Here are some screenies :)
