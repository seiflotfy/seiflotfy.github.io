title: First Sezen Screencast - An introduction to sexy simple searching

So after some intense hacking we decided to make a screencast of Sezen...

It is heavily inspired by Unity and Shell and we hope it can act as a usability testing app until the both are out...

Just like Unity, it uses Zeitgeist and followsÂ similar design concepts (thanks to David Siegel). It started evolving more after some intense hack + design sessions with DanRabbit (Elementary Project) + Jason Smith (Docky)

We do however intend to have a Tracker version of it upon release for benchmarking issues (As a side note we have a Zeitgeist extension that pushes into a custom Tracker branch that supports our "Zeitgeist Event Ontology" thanks to <a href="http://codethink.co.uk">Codethink</a>).

Upon release there will be support for FTS using the new Canonical sponsored FTS extension. The user will be able to choose to do so over our new Zeitgeist FTS extension or Tracker for the functionality.

We will host a sezen deb soon on the elementary ppa so stay tuned...

NOTE:

I WONT ADD LISTVIEWS... ITS JUST A <strong>SEXY </strong><strong>SIMPLE </strong><strong>SEARCH</strong> TOOL.
