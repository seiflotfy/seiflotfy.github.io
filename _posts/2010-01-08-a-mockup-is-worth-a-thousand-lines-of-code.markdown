I fully agree! Thanks to Hylke's mockup and guidance during the development of it, things started becoming more reality.

Randal Barlow hacked the little calendar on the bottom and the rounded corners. <a href="http://zeitgeist-project.com">The Zeitgeist Engine team</a> jumped in to fix bugs. Apoorca Sharma fixed some theme issues we had.Â <a href="http://collabora.co.uk">Collabora</a> finished "Teamgeist" which will be implemented in the UI and <a href="http://codethink.co.uk">Codethink</a> are helping us with the Tracker integration. Ahhhhhh I love you all :)

Here is the mockup

Here the implementation (missing the month labels) that took us around a week...
