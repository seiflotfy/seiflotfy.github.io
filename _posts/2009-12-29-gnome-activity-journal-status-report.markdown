This is a quick status report of the GNOME Activity Journal and its future development.
After a very stressful hackfest and a newly developed engine. We now how a new UI. It is still not there but I hope you like it for now.

<object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/NV0E16qLtVo&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/NV0E16qLtVo&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object>

The video sound is somehow delayed (not my fault) plus the loud sounds are the sounds of Cairo (Egypt).
