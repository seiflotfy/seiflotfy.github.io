I think it is safe to assume that as an open source project, striving to grow our community, we should make first interactions of new contributors with us a pleasant one.
So when commenting on a new contribution or attempt, we should try to <del>either</del> say something positive <del>or don't say anything</del>.
<ul>
	<li>If the<strong> contribution </strong>is<strong>  not useful</strong> then sugar coat you criticism. Because while the contribution might be bad, the person who did the contribution showed initiative to help out. We need to harvest this momentum and help integrate the person into the community.</li>
	<li>If the<strong> contribution </strong>is<strong> useful </strong>then praise the developer. Making him feel useful. I learned from Lydia Pintscher to not only praise good contributors, but grant them autonomy to play around. This would allow them to master their craft, which will lead to them feeling like they have a purpose to stay.</li>
</ul>
What do you think?
