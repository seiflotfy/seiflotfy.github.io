After <a href="http://castrojo.tumblr.com/">Jorge</a> linked me up with this <a href="http://www.outflux.net/blog/archives/2010/07/23/achievement-unlocked/">idea</a>

I quote from the blog post:
<blockquote>I think it would be fun to add an achievement system to the Ubuntu Desktop, like is done on <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/stats/TF2/achievements/">Steam</a> and <a href="http://www.xbox360achievements.org/">XBox</a>.

The tricky part is tracking various events and finding amusing correlations. For example, if your screen-saver kicks in 40 times in a single 24 hour period, you could earn the “Alternating Current” achievement, indicating that you’re being repeatedly interrupted all day long</blockquote>
I decided to give it a go and I already have a very early prototype of what I call "OMG!" since it will be co-maintainer by "<a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/">OMG! Ubuntu!</a>"(trophy ideas) and "some Zeitgeist devs"(Core Application)

Here are our 2 first trophies that already work...
