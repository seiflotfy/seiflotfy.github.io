title: Unity Place People - Day 2

Its my second day trying to hack Unity Place People. So far I managed to:
<ol>
	<li>Get chat activity from Zeitgeist</li>
	<li>Get Contacts from Folks</li>
	<li>Create Sections and Groups and assign them results</li>
</ol>
Todo over the weekend:
<ol>
	<li>Sort results using Zeitgeist (Most/Recent/Location)</li>
	<li>Find a nice grouping for the all section</li>
	<li>Enable searching</li>
	<li>Enable opening contacts</li>
</ol>
The difficulties I had till now were:
<ol>
	<li>Getting Folks to work, thanks to Mikkel, Michal and the Telepathy guys</li>
	<li>Getting the Personas from Folks (The Individual Aggregator gives me contacts for the "changed" signal, but no results when I ask it to give me the contacts manually. Bug?)</li>
	<li>The whole build mechanisms</li>
</ol>
Most of the difficulties are due to my love for python and the simplicity. However I am learning a lot while hacking this. Tomorrow I will write a short tutorial on how to work with Unity. And Monday I will try to write one how to work with Folks.

For now I will leave you with this...
