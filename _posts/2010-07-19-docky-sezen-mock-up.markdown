One of the things I enjoy about Elementary Project is that is has become a meeting point for designers, hackers and engineers. Here is a nice little mockup by "<a href="http://chawsum.deviantart.com/">chawsum</a>" to integrate Sezen into Docky

This will need some hard work and hacking from the Docky  side to make it possible but I hope Psyber'S can make it happen...
