title: Exhausting week with Zeitgeist.

The past week development on Zeitgeist was very intense. A release is pretty near we need to get done with our "Release" <a href="http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~gnome-zeitgeist/gnome-zeitgeist/gnome-zeitgeist/annotate/head%3A/TODO">TODO</a> list and fixed the high and medium priority <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/gnome-zeitgeist/+bugs?search=Search&amp;field.status=New&amp;field.status=Incomplete&amp;field.status=Confirmed&amp;field.status=Triaged&amp;field.status=In+Progress&amp;field.status=Fix+Committed">bugs</a> on launchpad.

But it is really hard when only 2-3 active developers are working. And some bugs and features dont really need Zeitgeist code knowledge like <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/gnome-zeitgeist/+bug/365923">this one</a>. Also a quick mock-up or code for an "item tag editor" would be very helpful.

Please feel free to visit us as #gnome-zeitgeist we are happy to walk you through the code and help you contribute.

On the other hand I am pretty psyched abotu SoC and already am sniffing around the Shell Code to help my student <a href="http://bloc.eurion.net/">RainCT</a> integrate zeitgeist into the GNOME Shell.

I will take this weekend off. I could use some outside time.
