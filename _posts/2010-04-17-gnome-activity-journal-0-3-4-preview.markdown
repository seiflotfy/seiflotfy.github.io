Randy just posted a video of the upcoming GNOME Activity Journal on <a href="http://velourdrome.blogspot.com/2010/04/gnome-activity-journal-034-preview.html">his blog</a>. It depends on the latest Zeitgeist trunk that should be released any time as soon as Siegfried is done with his exam.

For the video in case you are to lazy to give <a href="http://velourdrome.blogspot.com/2010/04/gnome-activity-journal-034-preview.html">Randy props on his blog</a> is here...

(Somehow after 1:30 minues nothing happens, seems like Randy forgot to stop recording)
