I think I reached a point where I feel burned out! It has been a long year. I am constantly jumping between Zeitgeist and Zeitgeist related projects in terms of hacking management and hyping. I am currently at the stage where I feel that I am not contributing anything of value to Zeitgeist or all related projects, a feeling accompanied by some inner emptiness. So to get back into shape and good hacking I will be taking some time off starting Saturday until next Thursday, to relax and chill. I will be following everything on IRC but I won't be writing any code or managing any bugs or blueprints. Tomorrow I will push all the branches I have been working on for Zeitgeist, Software Center and Cheers so they can be reviewed during my short break. If I am missing anything please dont hesitate to contact me...

Rock on Zeitgeist Team!!!
