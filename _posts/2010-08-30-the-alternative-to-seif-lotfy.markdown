title: "... the alternative to Seif Lotfy"

As stupid as it sounds I do get frustrated when people get my name wrong.
It is <strong>Seif Lotfy</strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saif">here is a wikipedia link for the meaning and pronunciation of Seif</a>).

I hear and read some mispronunciations and misspellings of <strong>SEIF</strong> like:
<ul>
	<li>Sief</li>
	<li>Siev</li>
	<li>Safe</li>
	<li>Save</li>
	<li>Seiv</li>
	<li>Sif</li>
</ul>
Also my last name <strong>LOTFY</strong> keeps being misread, thus resulting to:
<ul>
	<li>Lofty</li>
	<li>Lofti</li>
	<li>Lotfi</li>
	<li>Loufty</li>
</ul>
Now I can not  blame people for misreading and mispronouncing it. It is an Arabic name but sounds like taken from a Star Trek character. I had some funny encounters when trying to introduce myself. Here are some reactions I get:
<ul>
	<li>Ah is this your real name?</li>
	<li>OK this is your IRC name what is your real name?</li>
	<li>Oh seif as in SAFE... (stupid examples varying from safebox to safe sex)</li>
	<li>Bless you! (I swear that happened at UDS)</li>
	<li>WTF?</li>
	<li>HAHAHAHA you cant even pronounce your last name (stupid drunk barkeeper)</li>
</ul>
So to end these occurrences i decided to adopt a new alternative "hacker name"...
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>STEVE LOFTY</strong></h2>
<strong>
</strong>

So for anyone who has issues with my name please refer to the the alternative. I will work on reacting to it. You can now even contact me under:
<ul>
	<li>steve.lofty&lt;at&gt;googlemail.com</li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/stevelofty">http://twitter.com/stevelofty</a></li>
</ul>
Thanks for your tolerance...

Steve Lofty (Seif Lotfy)
