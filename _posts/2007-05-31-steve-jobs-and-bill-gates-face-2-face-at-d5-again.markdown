So i visited <a href="http://d5.allthingsd.com/category/d5/">allthingsd D5</a> today.
WOW amazing interview. Too bad they didn't have anyone form the Linux community there. How would it have been if Mark Shuttleworth or Linus Travolds were on stage with all these patent lawsuits going on. I wonder .......

However these videos are amazingly funny and interessting.
