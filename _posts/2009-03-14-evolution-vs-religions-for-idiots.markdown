I am going to hell for this, but wtf! I participated in a conversation at a friends birthday party! God forgive me!
<blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>X: "There is no such thing as God and religion is made up so people can find answers to their existence!"</li>
	<li>Y: "WTF?"</li>
	<li>X: "Those who hang on to their religions are ignorant idiots who can't accept the fact that they are some creatures that used to swim in the sea and grew legs."</li>
	<li>Y: "Then who made you?"</li>
	<li>X: "Evolution!"</li>
	<li>Y: "I mean where did you come from!"</li>
	<li>X: "My mom's vagina you freak"</li>
	<li>Y: "Okay, well where did she come from?"</li>
	<li>X: "Her mom's vagina. And her mom's vagina before that. This goes all the way back to that creature in the sea that grew legs."</li>
	<li>Y: "Ok, where'd that come from?"</li>
	<li>X: "His legless mom's vagina. We all pop out of vaginas."</li>
	<li>Y: "These vaginas all poped out form something"</li>
	<li>X: "I guess they all come from one big, giant vagina."</li>
	<li>Y: "Yeah, and that's God."</li>
	<li>X: ".Hmmmm I guess you are right"</li>
</ul>
