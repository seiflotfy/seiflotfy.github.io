Hi everybody,
As you all know Zeitgeist has been trying to make rapid strides in the linux desktop and the Zeitgeist team is working really hard to enhance and improve the desktop experience and integration in Ubuntu, KDE and GNOME.

To get more feedback from our fellow users and updating our beloved readers about all the development that has been brewing in the camp, we have decided to have a Zeitgeist Twitter account and a Facebook page.

Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/TeamZeitgeist">http://twitter.com/TeamZeitgeist</a>
Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=117610428264866">https://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=117610428264866</a>

Do follow the twiiter page and like the Facebook page to keep yourself informed. We would start posting a lot of things. You can even pass on your wish if you find bug trackers too difficult to use. It doesnt matter if you a programmer or artist or lawyer or a rock/metal musician. All of you are welcome.
