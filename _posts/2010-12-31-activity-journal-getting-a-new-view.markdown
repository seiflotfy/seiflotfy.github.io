I am blessed with some amazing team. The magnificent <a href="http://devcando.wordpress.com">Cando</a> just finished a new view for Activity Journal. It took me by surprise since all I did was suggest this view to be done, then he showed me what I thought is a mockup. Only it wasn't <a href="http://devcando.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/gaj-towards-a-new-view/">check it out</a> on his blog.  Basically its a graph that displays subject usage_count per day (item count/day) which is very useful tracking work stuff done each day.

The next iteration will include time spent on a document instead of the count. Of course this is powered by... you know its Zeitgeist :P
