Just a quick notice that the Zeitgeist team released <a href="http://thekorn.wordpress.com/">Zeitgeist Framework 0.6</a> and also the<a href="http://milky.manishsinha.net/2010/11/01/release-zeitgeist-sharp-0-1-0/"> Zeitgeist-Sharp bindings 0.1</a>

Also our Rhythmbox plugin landed with the latest Rhythmbox release. We will be proposing more patches and plugins upstream during this month (gedit/tomboy/banshee/totem/eog)

Time to party!
