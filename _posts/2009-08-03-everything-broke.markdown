<p>1. Laptop: My "F'ed up piece of SH*T" of a laptop (DELL XPS 1330) constantly overheated and had the nvidia malfunction. During GCDS my notebook stopped charging and was on low performance all the time + hot as hell! My brothers netbook benchmarks 2x faster than my shitty laptop! And to top it off Eclipse + firefox + pidgin + Do +banshee makes it freeze then crash! WARRANTY EXPIRED</p><p>
2. Desktop: While plugging in an external HDD it just turned off and wont turn on again! :(</p><p>
3. iPhone:..... The screen is constantly white with some stripes! turned it off and on and even restored its setting but can see crap! While writing here the whole screen turned red!</p><p>
4. TV: won't work! won't turn on!</p><p>
I am feeling pretty naked at the moment! Pretty crappy situation! Right now I am using my brothers netbook! Thinking of getting one myself!</p>
