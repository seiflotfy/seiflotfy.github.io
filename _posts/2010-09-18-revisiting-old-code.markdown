While Siegfried is fixing the bugs Randy and I have been brainstorming and designing a new feature for the Activity Journal... We started digging into some old code and I found something I did back in 2008.. Here was the screenshot back then.

Doesn't it remind you of the Shell &amp; Bidboard sidebar a bit ?

This is really old code back then when I was hacking on Gimmie and Mayanna. I am shocked I actually found it again.

So I challenged myself to see how much of this I can actually fix and try it out again.

I know its shitty but I think I wanted to show something I did before working on Zeitgeist.
