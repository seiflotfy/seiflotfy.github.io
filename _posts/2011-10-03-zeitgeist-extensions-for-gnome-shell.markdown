title: Zeitgeist extensions for GNOME Shell

I started working on getting the GNOME Shell - Zeitgeist work by Federico's GSoC student <a href="http://blog.kitallis.in/">Akshay Gupta (kitallis)</a> more stable and visually appealing. I am not a designer but I think this is not that bad... I hope I can get Hylke or Garrett to look at it with me during the week.

Currently its an extension you can get from <a href="http://db.tt/1APxzqac">here...</a> (You will need to install the latest stable Zeitgeist)

Here are some screen-shots. I will be working on it more this week and expect a nice git branch with some final touches (I will be changing some functionality to be more convenient)
