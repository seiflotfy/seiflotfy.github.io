OMG! OMG! OMG! We are close to releasing.... a beta.

After porting the daemon to Mono with Chris Szikszoy (Docky fame) and with the support of David Siegel and Alex Launi (both from Do Fame and more) the daemon is almost stable.

You can check out the code by running the following in a terminal: -

<strong>bzr branch lp:omg</strong>

The OMG! team has been working on a trophy set to release within the next 2 weeks.

<strong>WE ARE MISSING AN ACHIEVEMENT VIEWER !!!</strong>

So guys please if you feel like mocking up something throw designs at us here. Even better would be if you want to hack it with us. Since the OMG! daemon uses DBus you can hack the UI in any language you feel like. (Python, Mono, Vala, whatever...)
