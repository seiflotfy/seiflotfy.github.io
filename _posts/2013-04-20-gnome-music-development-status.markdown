The last weeks a lot of volunteers showed up to develop on (GNOME) Music.

Now we can browse the albums and their content making it our most complete view. Playback to the albums view and songs view is in development (works but is buggy).

Also we are heavy working on the artist view trying to match the mockups, currently the code delivers the following screenie:

There is still a lot to be done, and we created a <a href="https://live.gnome.org/Music">semi roadmap of our development plan</a>. Phase 1 should be completed within the next 2 - 3 weeks. We also moved our UI development to be glade.

I am very happy with the contributor turnout (no special order):
<ul>
	<li>Vadim Rutkovsky</li>
	<li>Eslam Mostafa</li>
	<li>Paolo Borelli</li>
	<li>Guillaume Quintard</li>
	<li>Allan Day</li>
	<li>Jakub Steiner</li>
	<li>Shivani Poddar</li>
	<li>Sriram Ramkrishna</li>
	<li>Hylke Bons</li>
</ul>
Nice to have this mix of old and new contributors working together. If interested join us on #gnome-music on gimpnet. This is where the communication happens.
