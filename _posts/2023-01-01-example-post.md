# Building the Future of Tech

At Autoencoded Ventures, we're focused on working with the <span class="highlight">smartest founders</span> solving the most difficult problems where <span class="highlight">AI</span>, <span class="highlight">datastores</span>, and <span class="highlight">infrastructure</span> meet.

3. **Infrastructure** - Cloud-native technologies, networking, and compute platforms
