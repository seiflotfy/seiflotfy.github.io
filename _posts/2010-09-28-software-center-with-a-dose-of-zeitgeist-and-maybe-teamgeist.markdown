title: Software Center with a dose of Zeitgeist and maybe Teamgeist

Today the Zeitgeist team showed Michael Vogt a possible integration of Zeitgeist with Software Center. And guess what he likes it and he will look into making it become a soft dependency. He will look into merging our branch soon. All it does is tell you how many times you used an application in the detailed view.

So its pretty simple, and this is by no means how the design will be, but guess what there is more to come...

Using this we will start a whole new integration initiative during the Natty cycle. Some new features will make usage of the awesome teamgeist such as:

- How many people (and who from your friends list) have the application installed.

- People who use this app also use application "XYZ"
