We are very busy preparing:
<ol>
	<li>Zeitgeist 0.4</li>
	<li>GAJ 0.3.5</li>
	<li>Sezen 0.1</li>
	<li>Zeitgeist-Extensions  0.1 (Tracker, Geo-Location and Full Text Search)</li>
	<li>Zeitgeist-Loggers 0.1 (Package with plugins for apps to send infos to Zeitgeist)</li>
	<li>LibZeitgeist (A C wrapper around our D-Bus API)</li>
</ol>
But most interesting would be some integration we are working on to blend into the desktop experience... we have a new plugin that displays some of the statistics of your listening habits in Rhythmbox. It needs some polishing and will be released with the next wave of release.
