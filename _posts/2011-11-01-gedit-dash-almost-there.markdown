title: Gedit - Dash (Almost there)

So now after three days of hacking around we are almost done with the gedit "plugins". I say plugins (plural) because I divided the Dash plugin in 2. One for the "notebook" part, to handle the tabs properly in the new "form" (still a bit buggy though) and the other one for the actual Dash.

It now looks like this...

<p style="text-align: left;">Still to do is actually having the thumbs avoid showing the headers of the files (imports, license, etc.. and somehow skip to the classes)</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Also we are playing with the idea of a search for the dash... This work has not been reviewed by Hylke yet and is more or less me taking a stab in the dark. This way you open a tab and can start typing to search. Then select your result and it opens. For the search we use Zeitgeist since we need to cover stuff you "Downloaded" using the Firefox datasource or stuff you opened with gedit before...</p>
