We are trying to implement rounded corners with pygtk. The only solution way to do it is to use cairo afaik. Can some1 help us out with that. Code snippets would be awesome. We need it for the day headers. Also u might like to help us hack the calendar as seen on the mockups from the previous post. Cheers
