5 years after deploying "Ubuntu 4.10 (Warty Warthog)" on my laptop back in November 2004, I have become an Ubuntu member. Thanks to all the awesome people who cheered for me and pimped up my <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SeifLotfy">wiki</a>.This is more motivation to hack. Hopefully I will get more involved with community (<a href="http://geekyogre.com/2009/10/floss-vs-me/">especially in my country</a>) as much as upstream.
