So we at Zeitgeist we are working on the 0.6 milestone... The team is active and <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/zeitgeist/+milestone/0.6">progress is looking awesome</a>.

To get more people to dive into writing code with us the Zeitgeist team is offering mentorship on fixing some bugs.

Some of them  <strong>do not require an understanding</strong> how Zeitgeist works (Please read our comments though and attachments to the bug):
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bugs/660440">Using logging output for debugging purposes</a> (This is a generally easy bug to fix)</li>
	<li><a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bugs/643303">Upgrade of the db schema strategy for version jumps</a> (This should be a fun one to fix since the target file to be worked on is sql.py)</li>
	<li><a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bugs/660415">zeitgeist-daemon.py has a bad code structure</a> (The file only consists of  130 lines including lots of comments that just need to be organized)</li>
</ul>
One more or less advanced (yet not so difficult to fix) bugs is:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/bugs/397715">I18N of Zeitgeist</a> (here we need help with setting up only <strong>some </strong>translation areas, so <a href="https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/zeitgeist/+bug/397715/comments/8">please read this comment for more info</a>)</li>
</ul>
To fix these bugs all you need is:
<ul>
	<li>Passion for hacking</li>
	<li>Good Python knowledge</li>
	<li>Sense of humor</li>
	<li>Love for Zeitgeist</li>
</ul>
