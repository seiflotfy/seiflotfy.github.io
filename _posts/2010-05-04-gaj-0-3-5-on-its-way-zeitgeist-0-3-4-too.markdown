<a href="http://velourdrome.blogspot.com/2010/05/gnome-activity-journal-035-progress.html"></a>Once this is done we are moving GAJ (not Zeitgeist) to git :)

0.3.5 will provide a new sidebar that open when right clicking an item and asking for "more information"...
Also performance will be improved by miles as well as full support for Tomboy, Firefox, Empathy and maybe just maybe Evolution (I am working on a loggers installer)

This release will rock...
And also stay tuned for Zeitgeist 0.3.4 which will introduce ZEO (Zeitgeist Event Ontology), improved data associations, negation queries and wild cards.....
The weeks ahead will be crazy so stay tuned...
