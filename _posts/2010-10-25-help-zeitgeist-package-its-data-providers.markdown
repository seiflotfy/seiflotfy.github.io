So after a year of development we are almost done with our first set of <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/zeitgeist-dataproviders">Zeitgeist data providers</a>.

<strong>What are Zeitgeist data providers?</strong>

Its a set of plugins and extension for applications to push their activity into Zeitgeist thus allowing them to be viewed in GNOME Activity Journal or used else where.

<strong>What data providers are now <a href="https://code.edge.launchpad.net/zeitgeist-dataproviders">supported</a>? (besides everything that already pushes into Gtk.RecentlyUsed)</strong>
<ol>
	<li>bzr</li>
	<li>git</li>
	<li>Rhythmbox</li>
	<li>Totem</li>
	<li>gedit</li>
	<li>Eye of GNOME</li>
	<li>vim</li>
	<li>Geany</li>
	<li>Chrome/Chromium</li>
	<li>Firefox</li>
	<li>Emacs</li>
	<li>Telepathy</li>
	<li>Tomboy</li>
</ol>
<strong>What now?</strong>

Although we are working on getting things upstream (Rhythmbox is upstream now) we still want a one stop destination for users to download zeitgeist plugins for their applications. We want to host them later on our <a href="http://zeitgeist-project.com/">website</a> in a little repository.

Thus we need people to help us package them so please contact us on #zeitgeist on irc.freenode.net if u can help us package stuff and write installer scripts.
