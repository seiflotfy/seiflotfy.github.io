UDS is coming and sadly none of the Zeitgeist core devs can make it. Our only hope Markus Korn caught a flu during the Zeitgeist hackfest. However Jason Smith who was involved in the setting up of the blueprints of the soon to be released 0.3 engine will be there. He is very up to date and hopefully can answer most of the questions if he has time.
