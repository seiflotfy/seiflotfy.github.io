1. Markus Korn (our dataprovider guru) managed to write his first client. I don't want to ruin it forÂ  by telling you what the client does but here is a kick ass video of his <a href="http://files.getdropbox.com/u/174479/zeitgeist/fullscreen.ogv">work</a> and look at the <a href=" https://edge.launchpad.net/zeitgeist-filesystem">branch</a>.

2. At GCDS I started a parental control prototype (during the Richard M. Stallman talk) and I previewed at the the Zeitgeist presentation and in front of the GNOME adivsory board. I know ppl may hate it but it is a proof of concept, being able to to subscribe for events from zeitgeist analyzing them and creating reactions. Again we can provide applications that subscribe to us with documents of the event as well as apps that produced the event. But enough talk lets <a href="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/pc.ogv">walk</a>!

So more hacking with the Tracker boys today! KICK ASS!
