I am working on a dashboard (start page) for gedit... My initial idea looks something like this

<a href="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2011/10/EHbnt1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2054" title="EHbnt" src="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2011/10/EHbnt1.png" alt="" width="554" height="326" /></a>

(the thumbnails will view some parts of the content of the file)

We are not sure that for gedit that  "Frequent" is of interest for us, that maybe we can be happy just with Frequent... However before we take any decisions we decided to appeal to all <strong>gedit users</strong> who have been <strong>using Zeitgeist for over a month </strong>to use run the <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7162902/usage.py"><strong>following script</strong></a> in a terminal via
<blockquote>python usage.py</blockquote>
and paste the results as a comment... Help us make gedit more awesome :)
