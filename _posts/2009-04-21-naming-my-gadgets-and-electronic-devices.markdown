I have been reading a lot of blog entries about how people call their computer etc....
I tend to use names from the peanuts....

Desktop: Snoopy
Virtual Machine on Desktop: Virtual Snoopy
Laptop: Schroeder
Virtual Machine on Laptop: Virtual Schroeder
iPod: Charlie
Home Netwrok: Snoopyland
Cellphone: Linus
Girlfriend/Fiance's Laptop: Lucy

Since I am changing my life I thought I should change all that. So here are other themes i would love to name after:

1.Star Wars
2.Southpark
3.Spongebob
4.Simpsons
5.He-Man
6.Nintendo Characters

Any suggestions or preferences?
