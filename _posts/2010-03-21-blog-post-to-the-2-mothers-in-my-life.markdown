It is mothers day in the middle east and although I live in Germany I still would like to honor this day and the 2 mothers in my life. It is sad I am expressing my feelings on mothers day, I think this blog post should have been out a looooooooong time ago.

To mom number one:
<blockquote>Sorry for not being the best son out there, and sorry for not showing my gratitude enough. You really had a hard time raising me and my brothers. Sadly I was not always the good big brother, else it would have reflected on my 2 brothers behavior. I miss you a lot and I am sorry I can not visit Egypt as often as I would like to. After dad passed away you had a hard time keeping us together but u managed and I am very proud of you. Your determination to provide us with a very good life and putting us before everything else is an inspiration. I love you and miss you...</blockquote>
To mom number two:
<blockquote>I think I should start by saying "Hi Nini". I love you and I hope you know that... Again I might not show it but I really do... You always were there for me and got me out of every crappy situation I got into. You and Bob taught me so many things, that there is nothing I do that I can not derive from something you helped me out with. I know my appearance and lifestyle does not make you happy but I am working on it to make you proud of me. I owe you so much and I cant express how much you mean to me...</blockquote>
You 2 are the best mothers any1 could wish for...

P.S: My mom taught me "if and else" conditions, when I was 13 or 14 based on her pascal experience and my aunt bought me my first programing book "Visuall C++ in 21 days" which took me a year back then (I was 15). So if you like my work then it kinda derives from their help and support. So a nice commt to them would be appreciated and a nice mothers days gift.
