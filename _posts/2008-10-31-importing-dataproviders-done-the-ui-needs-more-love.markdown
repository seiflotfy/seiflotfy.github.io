title: Importing Dataproviders done! The UI needs more love!

I managed to import Pidgin as a data provider for the Journal. Since it took it one to one from Gimmie/Mayanna I need to change a lot of unnecessary code.

The UI need to be improved since its pretty slow when it needs to load all the items. Is there a way how i can change Items in a gtk.Iconview without having to reload the whole thing? Since the data providing works like charm I won't really be concentrating on it for now!

Tonight or tomorrow I will be documenting the code while cleaning up more of it. This should make it easier for interested developers to follow!

Now to the main point.

The UI needs more love...Any volunteers?
