I managed to get around to extend my extensions and fix some minor issues... The extensions now can "search". Not only does it allow you to search your files better and categorize them. It also overwrites the standard search of shell to sort you applications by "most launched" (thanks to jimmac's hint). Now when i search for "ch" i get chrome first and not cheese.

The Journal overview is more or less the same. However under the "recent", "new", "frequent" and "shared" u can really expand anymore. You are forward to the category by clicking the "m0re" button. There is much more to come. I will be fixing bugs and adding jumplists soon.
