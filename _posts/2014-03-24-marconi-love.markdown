I have lots of positive things to say about the OpenStack community. They managed to create a great mixture of professional yet agile and FLOSSy. Amazing CI/CD and devstack is just an awesome way to kickstart development on OpenStack.

Last month I discovered Marconi (https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Marconi)... 

Basically its a new MQ written in pure Python and allos different backends. The awesome thing is you can run it without having to run the whole openstack stuff and it works... It is still a young project but the community around it its awesome ans their IRC #openstack-marconi is very responsive. These guys could use a hand so if you are a Python enthusiast or want to hack on something OpenStack related without needing to have the whole stack running, please show some support and try to help out. There is a lot of low hanging fruit (https://bugs.launchpad.net/openstack/marconi) :)
