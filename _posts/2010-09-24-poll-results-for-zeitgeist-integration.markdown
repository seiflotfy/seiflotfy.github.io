It would be interesting for you to know that we already have data providers for most of them. Â You can find them all <a href="https://edge.launchpad.net/zeitgeist-dataproviders">here</a>.

What we need now is a 2 way integration with Zeitgeist. Currently we can push the info from the applications into Zeitgeist. However we should make use of the information gathered inside the applications. <a href="http://mhr3.blogspot.com/">Michal Hruby</a> and I will be taking charge of these integration with the support of <a href="http://manishtech.wordpress.com/">Manish Sinha</a>.
