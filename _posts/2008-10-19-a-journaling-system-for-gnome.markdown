During the UI Hackfest in Boston a lot of ideas have been sketched and some of them already under development! The one that caught my attention the most was Federico's <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/docs/2008-GUADEC/html/index.html">Presentation</a>. If this can be turned into reality it could be a step forward to reach Gnome 3.0.

It saddens me however that some of the ideas in the presentation have been already developed in <a href="http://beatniksoftware.com/gimmie/Main_Page">Gimmie</a> before. Gimmie provides a semi History browsing for everything from documents to applications and even Pidgin chats.

All it would take is some modifications to the Gimmie code and u got yourself a kick ass application that fulfills all of the Points set by Federico.

Here is a take on the Gimmie/Mayanna based <a href="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/mayanna-timeline.zip">version</a>. It had some memory issues but all in all it does a pretty nice job for a timeline.

It updates on new events and supports tagging into favorites... its not much but it is a good example for an approach! I will give myself more time soon to really modify it all!
