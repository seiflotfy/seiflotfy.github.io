It has been a very bumpy road for Zeitgeist with GNOME. I really don't feel like going into details and history since this won't help us proceed. I admit my part of the problem.

While I might not be the best developer around I do try to bring something new to the table and I do hope that GNOME can see it at some point. What started off as a GNOME project is now being endorsed by Unity, KDE and lots of small community projects. We worked on being a cross-desktop project with our roots in GNOME. I am not going to debate what needs to be changed in Zeitgeist to be more GNOME friendly (moving to git etc...) since its not fair for other deployments and not fair for us as developers who are used to our work environment. And while I might be the face of Zeitgeist the project has outgrown me and we have lots hackers and contributors around, so please feel free to get to know them.

So to sum it up:

"Sorry we've disagreed about things or I've come across badly in the past. I didn't mean to be impolite. just want to help bring some cool features to GNOME and GNOME Shell. I hope we can have a clean start and try and get along well from here"
