Sebastian Faubel came up with a nice icon for Zeitgeist

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-693" title="zeitgeist-icon" src="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/2009/06/zeitgeist-icon.png" alt="zeitgeist-icon" width="192" height="192" />

Before UDS I started hacking on an alternative GTK+ UI for the Zeitgeist engine and within days I will have it complete. I think this view could be used for ARM based UNR distributions since they don't use clutter. The Categories are created dynamically. I will add most used and bookmarks to it soon. It is simple, clean and touch friendly.

Now its time to hang out on the roof!
