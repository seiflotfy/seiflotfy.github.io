As some of you might know by now, <a href="http://milky.manishsinha.net/">Manish Sinha</a> has been rocking the Zeitgeist boat with his zeitgeist-sharp library and the Tomboy and Banshee plugins (the latter is now a community extension).
<a href="http://milky.manishsinha.net/2010/11/21/zeitgeist-in-my-blood/">In his post</a> he describes the experience of working with the Zeitgeist team in terms of development, QA and decision taking, as well as his future involvement.

I am very pleased and I think I speak on behalf of the Zeitgeist team when I say we are very happy and lucky to have him onboard. <a href="http://milky.manishsinha.net/2010/11/21/zeitgeist-in-my-blood/">Please read the post and leave a nice comment if possible.</a>
