So in case you have not tried it yet here is a video of me fiddling with Docky ... I am adding a Journal for every app YAY ... (still alpha)

The Docky team is rocking and are open to all kinds of discussions. They are my second favorite team behind the Zeitgeist team. We started sharing devs which is a big plus. Their devs started doing some python stuff for the Zeitgeist extensions. I will be heading back to more Zeitgeist work though since we have Teamgeist about to come out.
