So a couple of days ago I promised a Nautilus + Zeitgeist hack... Thanks to Randy it is reality (and I am not a liar)...It is just a proof of concept, we will take time next week to look into details and make things really shiny... Read his <a href="http://velourdrome.blogspot.com/2010/03/i-modified-zeitgeist-filesystemsfuse.html">blog</a> for more info

Oh yeah here is the sexy stuff if you are to lazy to click and read his blog...
