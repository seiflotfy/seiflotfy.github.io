After some silence, our research brain and user experience visionary <a href="http://uni-stuttgart.academia.edu/ThorstenPrante" target="_blank">Thorsten Prante</a> is getting vocal again. For those of you who don't know: he is mentoring Stefano's current GSoC revamp of the activity journal.

In his post <a href="http://reflaction.info/?p=270" target="_blank">GSoC 2012 – Journal! Revamp!</a>, he provides a nice list of example echos of the activity journal across the web from past to present before he goes on to explain why "in this project, beyond adding new features and types of activity footprints, we’re introducing a new way of showing the Activity Journal to its users."
