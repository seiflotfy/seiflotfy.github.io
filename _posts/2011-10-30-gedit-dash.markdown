So over the weekend "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" Hylke Bons and I joined forces (just like during the GAJ days) to work more on the design of the Dash...

The gedit team gave some very good feedback till now, and I will be doing some work on Gedit soon

However back to the design and implementation work I am doing with Hylke...
<ul>
	<li>We moved the toolbar to be inside the tab, this is something the gedit guys are considering to have upstream so I will look into finishing it over the next week. Also for the sake of the Dash we removed the "New"  button and "Open" button.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Hylke came up with some nice modifications to the Dash itself... I think the snapshot says everything. We also added a "+" Tab.</li>
</ul>
