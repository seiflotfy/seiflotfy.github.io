As of the beginning of the April I am a [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) (that is what Xamarin employees call themselves).

At Xummit I met the rest of the Xamarins and I had an incredible time there (dare I say magical ♥).
I met old friends like Rodrigo Moya, Jason Smith, David Siegel, Cody Russell, Neil Patel, Connor Curran, Gord Allot and others, but also made new friends:

* **Zack Gramana**: The right amount of crazy and creative. He is helping me with my new pet project.
* **Seth Rosetter**: SF chilled out hacker with an ear for techno and extreme positive attitude, a delight to hang out with.
* **Mike Krüger**: One of the friendliest people I got to meet and know with exactly my kind of humour.
* **Victoria Grothey**: Incredibly nice person with lots of energy and always smiling.
* **Marek Safar**: The most passionate beer expert I know I guess. Also rumour has it that either I am stalking him or he is stalking me.
* **Václav Vančura**: An awesome designer who motivated me to start drawing again. Thanks for that.
And many many more.

One thing I believe in, is that interpersonal relationships between co-workers is a must for a community or a company to be productive and successful. Xamarin promoted (and still promotes) this positive habit, achieved it and even more. The **upbeat** attitude and **enthusiasm** at Xamarin is infectious. Combined with the **diversity** in culture as well as stuff/tasks to do brings the best out of Xamarins. I will not forget the bus ride to the venue. 8 people with 7 different nationalities, but all happy and psyched about what they are doing and what others are doing ♥.

Since I joined Xamarin I started doing more Mono in my free time too. Currently I am porting 

[Synapse](http://lifehacker.com/lifehacker-pack-for-linux-2013-our-list-of-the-best-li-815376368#productivity) to Mac (since I loved the interface and some of the functionalities I couldn’t find in Alfred and Quicksilver).
Here is a small very early sneak peak :)

I am loving Xamarin and all its stands for and brings to the table.

P.S: **Hylke Bons** has a fan base here at Xamarin :)
