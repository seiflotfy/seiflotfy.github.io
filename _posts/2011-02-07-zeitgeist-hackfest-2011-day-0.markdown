title: Zeitgeist Hackfest 2011 Day 0

After a successful experience at the Zeitgeist Hackfest 2009 at Bolzano, we decided on short notice that another hackfest is needed. The hackfest this year will focus alot on remaining blueprints of the Zeitgeist engine but even more on <strong>deploying</strong> Zeitgeist in GNOME via plugins and integration with GNOME Shell.

The hackfest is more or less a sprint where we are not discussing as much as we are actually getting work items done where we did not come around to.

I must say I am very thankful for GNOME and Collabora for sponsoring the event as the Aarhus CS department for providing us with the venue.
