Ladies and Gentlehackers,

I would like to congratulate (Dr. to be) Thorsten Prante for taking up on blogging... His first <a href="http://reflaction.info/?p=28">blogpost</a>, surprise surprise, is about some ideas behind Zeitgeist... Also a <a href="http://reflaction.info/wp-content/content/images/PersonalExperienceTrace_prante-etal.pdf">paper</a> about Zeitgeist has been accepted for <a href="http://personalinformatics.org/chi2010">CHI Workshop</a>... Please enjoy....
