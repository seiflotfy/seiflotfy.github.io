I have been absent from blogging a bit :(
So here are the highlights of the past month:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://live.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Clock">GNOME Clocks</a> is shaping up nicely, a nice example of prototype becoming product. It is a very nice experience for me in developer &lt;-&gt; designer communication. Something that I have been working on with <a href="http://afaikblog.wordpress.com/">Allan Day</a>, <a href="http://jimmac.musichall.cz/">Jakub Steiner</a>, <a href="http://linuxart.com/log/">Garret LeSage</a> and <a href="http://www.bomahy.nl/hylke/blog/">Hylke Bons</a>. (I will wrap up the code and push it up somewhere tomorrow). I will be giving a talk about this experience along with Allan Day (including prototyping) at FOSDEM.</li>
	<li>The prototyping spirit within the GNOME design team is growing. After playing with  Jakub Steiner's <a href="view-source:http://jimmac.fedorapeople.org/gnome3/boxes/overlay-toolbar/">HTML/JS prototype</a> I got inspired to play with HTML/JS too.</li>
	<li>The Zeitgeist team set up a nice TODO list for the next release and beyond (blog post coming soon). Some awesome commit by <a href="http://mhr3.blogspot.com/">Michal Hruby</a> managed to reduce the memory consumption by a big chunk by "optimizing allocations of variants". Our bug list for the next release has only <a href="https://launchpad.net/zeitgeist/+milestone/0.9.0">4 more bugs open</a> so take a stab if you dare...</li>
	<li>Thanks to <a href="http://www.collabora.com/">Collabora</a>, I got a <a href="http://blogs.gnome.org/xclaesse/category/collabora/feed/swipe.nokia.com">N9</a>. After ruining my SIM card trying to build a Micro-SIM I ended up running to <a href=" http://www.o2.co.uk/">O2</a> getting myself one from there that got activated after 30 minutes. Now I am playing around with QML again.</li>
	<li>I started playing with <a href="http://plasma-active.org/">Plasma Active</a> and have very mixed feelings about it. Tech wise its pretty good, but I don't find it intuitive enough like GNOME 3 or Unity on a tablet. I seem to be missing the concept of activities really.</li>
	<li>I started getting into XBMC and now Ubuntu TV is announced... will be trying it out soon.</li>
	<li>I am addicted to <a href="https://live.gnome.org/EveryDetailMatters">Every Detail Matters</a>.</li>
</ul>
