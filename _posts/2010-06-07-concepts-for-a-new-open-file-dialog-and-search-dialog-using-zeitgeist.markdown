title: Concepts for a new "Open File Dialog" and "Search Dialog" using Zeitgeist

I have been pissed at the open file dialog for a while now and decided to make use of Zeitgeist to hack up a new one from scratch. I decided to use the concepts from  Elementary's Sezen for a Search Dialog...
The nice thing is we killed 2 birds with one stone here.
We have a prototype for a search and a open file dialog in one...

With Zeitgeist we will be able to associate other recent or most used files from other apps. The search is live too :)

I am now asking you guys here to tell me what you think of the 2 different views...
This is a functioning prototype that will be released with the next Zeitgeist if there is any demand and positive feedback...

<strong>* UPDATE #1:</strong>

I modified the UI again hope this is good enough :) keep criticizing where to move the widgets...

To explain a bit the arrows navigate in time between "Today, Last 2 Days, This Week, ...., This Year, All Time". "Latest and Popular" are for sorting :) latest being recently used and popular being most used.

<strong>* UPDATE #2:</strong>

More improvements done... it should look a bit more like danrabbits mockups...

There is another implementation I was playing with...
