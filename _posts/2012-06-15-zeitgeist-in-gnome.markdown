Words can not express how happy the Zeitgeist team is to see our little project with the Empathy and Folks developers merged into GNOME and finally bring some neat Zeitgeist features to the user.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to Zeitgeist, Folks and Empathy, including Collabora, Intel, Canonical and RedHat for their code and design contributions. I think the new design is very clean - <a href="http://blog.desmottes.be/post/2012/06/15/New-Empathy-contact-list">check out Guillaume Desmottes</a><a href="http://blog.desmottes.be/post/2012/06/15/New-Empathy-contact-list">Â blog post for screenshots</a>.

P.S: Stay tuned for our next release (release within 2 weeks) which will log telepathy interaction events out of the box (as part of the datahub). If you want to start logging now check out our standalone logger <a href="http://cgit.freedesktop.org/zeitgeist/zeitgeist-datasources">from the datasources repo on freedesktop</a>.
