Zeitgeist starts logging from the time its installed. It can not dig into the past.

However we have a workaround to retrieve the history out of a folder and inform Zeitgeist about it. Simply download the <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7162902/history.py">following script</a>

then use it like this:
<blockquote>python history.py /path/to/folder</blockquote>
/path/to/folder being the folder you want to pull history out of example: /home/seif/Documents

also for those devs who love <strong>emacs</strong> or <strong>vim</strong>

please install the <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7162902/emacs.zip">emacs plugin</a> and <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7162902/vim.zip">vim plugin</a>
