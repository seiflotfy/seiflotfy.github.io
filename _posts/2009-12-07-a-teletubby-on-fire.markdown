Our beloved Mikkel Kamstrup added a KICK ASS feature for Zeitgeist which will be used in Teamgeist and other apps of interest.

Imagine subscribing to live queries. As in get notified when an event happens that matches a custom zeitgeist-query.

Mikkel is to modest to show off so I will do it for him :P
