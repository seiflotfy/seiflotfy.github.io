After chatting with <a href="http://www.gnome.org/~federico/">Federico</a>. I showed him my quick gimmie/mayanna based prototype! He will be looking at the code to decide if it should be rewritten in c# or if we will modify the now existing python code or just take some classes! I hope it is the last one!I know for sure is that I will be writing him his providers

I added some new buttons to the layout! and an idea for filtering! its not functional though.Try <a href="http://geekyogre.com/content/images/mayanna-timeline.zip">it </a>out.

*UPDATE: Implemented (more or less took from gimmie/mayanna) a "create new document" dialog and button functionality.

**UPDATE: Implemented Tomboy support. Again taken from gimmie/mayanna

Here is a picture:
