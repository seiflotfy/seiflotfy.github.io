Michal Hruby is working on Sezen and one thing I noticed is that the IconView compared to Nautilus are JUST PLAIN UGLY... Look Here:

You can see the highlighted items look different in terms of "highlighting". The selection in nautilus sets a round frame around the text as well as the icon while the standard highlighting just look like a square around the item. Our question is how do we get our IconView to look like the one from Nautilus?
