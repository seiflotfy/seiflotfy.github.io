title: Growing a young open-source project with fresh contributors
---

Every open-source project starts off young with 1 to a handful of coders. In the early days it needs leadership and direction. This is mostly done by the initiators of the project, until it outgrows them, changes the leadership structure to a meritocracy. How fast it gets there depends on the project leadership as well as the kind of contributors that stick around.

**This post targets projects in the very early stages of development, without a proper beta release yet and a maximum exposure of probably a couple of articles on hackernews and reddit.**

Being involved in open-source projects and communities for a good 10 years now, one thing I learned is that to be part of an open-source project, one can't be just a user. Because lets face it, just using the software that doesn't make one part of a project.

While being a coder is the most common role, others roles like  promoter, artist, translator, etc... are very important to any project.

There is no formula on how to grow an open-source community and attract people. It all depends on the project and its maintainers/contributors.

Out of experience though I think the following best practices should be considered.

### Don't be rude or mean
As an open-source maintainer/group, striving to grow the community around a project, one should make first interactions of new contributors with the project/community pleasant. Being rude or mean won't attract contributors. Most developers are contributing in their free time so they have better stuff to do if they are treated badly.

### Contribution Guidelines
I am not sure about the usefulness of a contribution guideline up in the early days of an open-source project, since a lot changes. Its necessary for bigger ones, but one should not be strict about it. If contributors can't follow the contribution guidelines, then guide them personally, which will give the project a nice personal touch.

### Attracting opportunistic contributors
There are **user contributors** who use a project, stumble on an issue and try to fix it. They already have their entry point to contribute.

And then there are **opportunistic contributors** who like the idea of the project but don't really use it, but want to contribute. Those need an entry point for their contribution. That can be achieved by marking issues as "help wanted" or "easy", which will help them know where to start.

### Be thankful
Be thankful for first time contributions, regardless if they are any of the following:

* **BAD**: If the contribution is not useful then sugar coat the criticism. Iterate over it and guide them to make it better. Because while the contribution might be bad, the person who did the contribution showed initiative to help out. Its not so hard harvest this momentum and help integrate the contributor into the community with a different role.

* **GOOD**: 
If the contribution is useful then praise the developer. Making them feel useful.

Regardless of the type always give feedback.

### Get along with initial contributors
The initial contributors might end up being the face of the project. It is important to make sure there is a bond beyond just coding if possible. To deal with any misunderstanding of misbehaviours a code of conduct might help, but use collective decision when possible, e.g:

Use a collective decision to handle the difference between "Your code is shit" and "Shit I broke the code". One can look past the latter, the first however depends on the context.

Personally I am ok with the latter, the first however is inapproporiate.

### Purpose

Read [Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](https://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805), one can easily use the core idea behind the book the to grow the contributor base of any project, by granting contributors the following:

* **Autonomy**: People want to have control over their work. In open-source people want to have a say about the modules they work strongly on. If they are given that opportunity it will be follows by...
* **Mastery**: People want tone get better at what they do. Contributors will master their module and grow into maintainers or core developers. Which will give them a ...
* **Purpose**: People want to be part of something that is bigger than they are. They will feel responsibility and contribute to the big picture...
